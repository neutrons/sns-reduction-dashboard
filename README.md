# SNS Catalog Dashboard

A demo of the design of a dashboard for managing reductions, configurations, and
jobs from SNS.

# Installing

We need to install the NPM dependencies, so use the command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

# Running

To run, we currently use the `webpack-dev-server`, which we can run with:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
