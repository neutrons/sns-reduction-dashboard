# SNS Reduction Dashboard

An implementation of a web-based reduction controller for neutron scientists at
the Spallation Neutron Source. The overall goal is to be able to manage jobs
that are sent to a computing cluster that can reduce experimental data to a
more manageable size.

It uses the tools: Django, DjangoRestFramework, Nginx, and VueJS.

# Usage

There's a few key steps to use this application:

1. Create an environment file to configure the application.

    To do this, we need to create a `.env` file, which is done with:

    ```console
    $ make .env
    ```

TODO: Finish the rest of this...
